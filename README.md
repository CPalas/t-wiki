# t-wiki
Created repository t-wiki in the master branch
Created index and css file in rep to allow the page to be seen on internet
1. Make sure there is index page in the chosen rep
2. in repository 'settings' (on top right menu) section 'Github Pages' activate the source directory
3. directory might be 'master' or 'docs' 
4. after, in the same section Settings/GitHub Pages, the link for the website is visible
link: https://cpalas.github.io/t-wiki/
that is //<username>.github.io/<repname>/ as the rep is public
Modified HTML code to avoid robot search on the single page by inserting:
<meta name="robots" content="noindex"> in the head section
